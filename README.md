# todocalendar

Did a custom calendar UI with React based on the JavaScript Date() object. It was a pain but still fun.

The UI shows a calendar view of the current week labeled in german. Via buttons users can switch to the following or past weeks. By clicking on the hourly timeslots of any day, users can add a Todo to it. 

It was a while ago so the code is not too great. But everyone familiar with JavaScript Date() knows how annoying it is to work with so I still have to count this as an accomplishment. 

Also contains a custom made Date- and Time picker.
